# LINS: This package implements a method for the computation of all normal subgroups of a finitely presented group with at most some given index.
#
# This file runs package tests. It is also referenced in the package
# metadata in PackageInfo.g.

# Some tests need to check for graph isomorphism using grape
LoadPackage( "grape" );
# The computation of the tables (targets) requires the computation of schur multipliers
LoadPackage("cohomolo");
# Makes the computation of the tables (targets) faster
